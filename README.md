# Project-3 - Stepladder <img src='https://i.imgur.com/uXhmA4D.png' width="60"/>

<h1>Overview</h1>

The Brief for this project was to build a MERN stack application utilising:

* <strong>M</strong>ongoDB - document database
* <strong>E</strong>xpress(.js) - Node.js web framework
* <strong>R</strong>eact(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
* <strong>N</strong>ode(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

Working in a group of 4, it was decided that we create a job recruitment website, similar to Glassdoor. The focus would be to allow two main types of user, either a job seeker or company administrator, to login. The options available depend on the type of user that logs in, with job seekers being able to apply for jobs, and rate/comment on companies that they have worked for. Company Admins are able to post new job listings, and delete job listings. A Moderator account was also created that is able to do all of these things, as well as deleting company profiles if required.

<h2>Brief</h2>

* Work in a team, using **git to code collaboratively**.
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** 
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end.
