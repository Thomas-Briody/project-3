# Project-3 - Stepladder <img src='https://i.imgur.com/uXhmA4D.png' width="60"/>

<h1>Overview</h1>
The Brief for this project was to build a MERN stack application (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) Working in a team of 4, we decided to create a job search website, that allowed users to log in as a job seeker and apply for jobs, or a company admin, to post and delete job listings. We also wanted job seekers to be able to both rate and leave comments on companies they had previously worked for. This project really helped me to get a firmer grasp on React, and I am happy with the clean look of the final application. 

<h2>Brief</h2>

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end.
